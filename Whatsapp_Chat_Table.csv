310,2020-01-28 19:49:00,Tushar Nankani,The condition of k becomes true and therefore it enters the loop. From 2 to 20 with a gap of 2. Therefore it enters 10 times and i gets printed instead from 1-10 
311,2020-01-28 19:50:00,"Saket (TSEC, CS)",So conclusion is If there are multiple conditions in a single ' for loop' then even if one statement is satisfied then loop will run for that condition. 
312,2020-01-28 19:51:00,Tushar Nankani,"Yes. It's like any one of these conditions should be true. It's like using ""OR"". And not ""AND"". "

387,2020-01-29 22:24:00,+91 89764 07509,tune math.h library ko import nai kia na? 
388,2020-01-29 22:28:00,+91 89764 07509,infact mere hisaab se undeclared indentifier ka error bhi pop up hona chaiye tha but run horaha hai🤯🤯 
389,2020-01-29 22:47:00,"Saket (TSEC, CS)","This is because 52 (i.e. 25) might be stored as 24.9999999 or 25.0000000001 because the return type is double. When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24. To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler.

591,2020-02-08 12:27:00,+91 89764 07509,so is it that you are anyways converting the entered numbers of rows and columns to the set of 4 boxes

616,2020-02-08 22:15:00,+91 96536 93868,As far as I know signed int data type has a range of -32767 to 32767. After i becomes 32767 it will not be incremented to 32768 rather it will jump on the extreme left of the assigned range that is -32767 and hence the loop continues ... 
617,2020-02-08 22:15:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",See range of signed int is from -32768 to 32767 
618,2020-02-08 22:15:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",👍 yes 
619,2020-02-08 22:16:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",This thing is known as integer overflow

632,2020-02-08 22:30:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",You remember it as 2^no of bits 
633,2020-02-08 22:31:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Sorry 2^no of bits-1 for unsigned 
634,2020-02-08 22:33:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",And - 2^(no of bits-1) to 2^(no bits-1) -1 for signed 
635,2020-02-08 22:35:00,+91 89764 07509,for int byte size req is 2 so since 1 byte =8 bits hence 2bytes=16 bits 
636,2020-02-08 22:35:00,+91 89764 07509,therefore  2^(16)/2=32768 
637,2020-02-08 22:37:00,+91 89764 07509,bro its 2^no of bits only 
638,2020-02-08 22:37:00,+91 89764 07509,this you said was correct

923,2020-02-17 15:53:00,+91 90820 98830,From i th index you can move to i+1 or i-1 to find an integer that is same as the last index to jump there faster

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.  Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.     *Input:*  The first line contains a single integer N.  Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.     *Output:*  Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!     *Constraints:*  1 < N < 105  0 < Ak < 109 "

Codeforces  Please start practicing on hackerRank and HackerEarth first Get comfortable with it and then on codechef and codeforces  Otherwise problems on codechef and codeforces are enough to make u feel demotivated . Although there certain programmers specially like Abdullah Aslam 7 Star coder on codechef who directly started with codechef but i don't recommend that follow a straight and simple way and progress gradually. 
3328,2020-03-17 13:16:00,+91 73043 57388,"Ok everyone so let's start Road to CP 1. First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not. Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something. Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it. Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible 2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP. 3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend) Check out this video  https://youtu.be/4VD5wpLq1EQ  This video is by karan Gujar from Thakur college of Engineering  I know him personally. We were preparing for IIT together in RIIT classes Now he is a 6th star coder on codechef  Follow each and every point he told in the video.  Also follow him on quora for various answers and medium for his blog posts and tutorials.  Second person  Rachit jain Ex Microsoft Engineer 6th star coder at codechef follow his YouTube channel for guidance and specially his video  how I mastered Data Structures and Algorithms "

In Java if you write Obj object, it implicitly and in your class if there is no constructor,then javac automatically puts a non-paratmeterized constructor in your class Hence, implicit call *But* ,if you define a constructor in your class ,it is you who explicitly define it and hence that constructor will be used by javac in your program for object instantiation.

4329,2020-04-03 22:08:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",i was thinking about iterative only between pos of 1s 
4330,2020-04-03 22:09:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",didnt consider the fact that 0 answer was possible too 
4331,2020-04-03 22:10:00,+91 88305 26885,What was ur approach for checking permutation? 
4332,2020-04-03 22:10:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",what was ur tc? 
4333,2020-04-03 22:10:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",used set 
4334,2020-04-03 22:10:00,+91 88305 26885,Oh and then check is size equal to max element and all 
4335,2020-04-03 22:11:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",hmm wouldnt work for l2 though 
4336,2020-04-03 22:12:00,+91 88305 26885,My code took 342ms others had 42ms also 
4337,2020-04-03 22:13:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",ohhh 
4338,2020-04-03 22:13:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",how did u check permutation? 
4339,2020-04-03 22:14:00,+91 88305 26885,Inserted in the set maintained two variables for min and Max and then checked whether size is equal to max or not and  min =1 
4340,2020-04-03 22:15:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",nice i had thought about it but didnt think that would've been efficient xP 
4341,2020-04-03 22:15:00,+91 88305 26885,Hmm

4421,2020-04-05 17:18:00,+91 97681 67131,Anyone got solution to this? 
4422,2020-04-05 17:19:00,+91 82916 21138,Use stack 
4423,2020-04-05 17:20:00,"Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE)",No need to use that too Just a counter and an empty string's enough 
4424,2020-04-05 17:21:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",U solved it using stack? 
4425,2020-04-05 17:21:00,+91 97681 67131,In python converting it to str to list and since lists are like vectors i manuplate it and then at last convert it to str back 
4426,2020-04-05 17:22:00,+91 97681 67131,Is what I thought 
4427,2020-04-05 17:22:00,+91 97681 67131,Nope 
4428,2020-04-05 17:22:00,+91 82916 21138,I did not give today's mashup but I saw similar kind of stuff

4430,2020-04-05 17:22:00,+91 82916 21138,But without it it can be done 
4431,2020-04-05 17:23:00,+91 82916 21138,Its good problem but I saw something similar but was bit more high level so they used stack  I got confused and thought it's same problem 🤦🏻‍♂😅 
4432,2020-04-05 17:24:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",Could be solved by just traversing string.. 
4433,2020-04-05 17:25:00,+91 97681 67131,Oh u mean slicing 
4434,2020-04-05 17:26:00,+91 97681 67131,Ya thought of it but how would nesting of brackets work is where I got confused let me try that way 
4435,2020-04-05 17:30:00,+91 82916 21138,Stack will do the work 🤔 
4436,2020-04-05 18:31:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",
4437,2020-04-05 18:32:00,+91 97681 67131,Yes slicing joining i.e string manipulation I could make it work 
4438,2020-04-05 18:33:00,+91 97681 67131,This will work thanks

4553,2020-04-11 20:42:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","If you work in an organisation and you need to follow a certain structure, an interface can be used to have uniformity of structure, but difference of implementations.  Interfaces help to maintain uniformity and consistency. "
4554,2020-04-11 20:42:00,+91 73043 57388,"Interfaces are used when objects have common properties  For example Students common properties are Nane roll no DOB Etc  So student class can be parent class And student can be of engineering , medical, pharmacy etc So these branches becomes child classes "
4555,2020-04-11 20:48:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","Abstract classes can be used when you want to enforce only certain functions in that class and leave a choice for the other functions to be used or not.  The function signatures without the ```abstract``` keyword in the abstract class do not need to be implemented compulsorily in the class extending the abstract class, but they need to.have an implementation in the abstract class. Their implementation cannot be changed or defined in the class extending the abstract class like the abstract fns "
4556,2020-04-11 20:52:00,+91 73043 57388,Oh sorry this is Inheritance explanation 🤦 
4557,2020-04-11 20:53:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Yeah 
4558,2020-04-11 21:01:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Usually, interfaces are used to provide INDEPENDENT functionality. Like the ```Iterator``` interface allows objects to be iterated over, and the ```Runnable``` interface allows processes to run in a separate thread. You can have a class that is both iterable, and can run in a separate thread. Interfaces are for things that applicable to a broad range of objects different objects.  Classes provide MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE functionality. Like, if you have a ```Stack`` class and a ```Queue``` class. There is no point in creating a ``StackQueue``` class. "

4695,2020-04-12 17:30:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",For directed graphs we check for Strongly connected components using Kosarajus algo

It's very unfortunate thing that has happened and I my advice my fellow programming aspirants don't rush behind ratings, stars red coder etc focus on becoming a good programmer each day and try to learn new things all this ratings stars etc will come with time but u should not be ready to compromise ur ethics and values just for the sake of Show off and publicity because its not going to help in the long run.

Otherwise if there is at least two odd elements in array there is an answer consisting of this two elements. Otherwise array is only one odd element and there is no answer.

4974,2020-04-18 23:12:00,+91 73043 57388,The problems on finding subsets are usually called combination of numbers problem  For finding subsets u simply combine the concept of iteration and recursion   For that u have to create 2 arrays one will be having all given numbers Second array will be temporary array which is going to hold every possible subset by taking each number of the given array one by one  So suppose u have  Given array 1 2 3 4 And u wan to find all possible subsets  We use a for loop for traversing through the given loop  For(i=0;i<n;i++) {     temp[0]=arr[i];    Recursion_func }  We draw a recursion tree for that 
4975,2020-04-18 23:13:00,+91 73043 57388,Explaination of recursion function I will give u tomorrow if u don't mind

In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy. After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.  Repository Link- https://github.com/DarshanDeshpande/COVID-19-Detector  A small version of the dataset on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset  Thank you for your time!

Since the size of numbers is huge, we can't make use of the primary memory to serve the purpose. 1) Divide the numbers in group of k. 2) Sort each group independently in O(klogk). ( using internal sort - Quick Sort )     Merge sort all the groups. 3) Create a min heap of size=10 billion/k. 4) Update the min heap with the minimum from each group. 5) Extract the minimum from the heap and write to a file. 6) Get the next number from the group from which extracted number belonged. 7) Update the min heap. 8) Go to step 5.    *Approach 2:- Using Doubly Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ)*  1) Read in as many elements as will fit into DEPQ.    The elements in DEPQ will eventually be the middle group of elements. 2) Proces the remaining elements one at a time.    If the next element <= smallest element in the DEPQ, output this element as a part of the left group.    Else if the next element is greater  than the largest element in DEPQ, output it as a part of right group. 3) Otherwise, remove  either the min or max element from the DEPQ. 4) Output the elements in DEPQ in sorted order. 5) Sort the left and right groups recursively.  _In approach 2, we are simulating the quick sort, In quick sort , the array is broken into  L,M,R._ _where M is just a single pivot element. But in approach 2 , the whole DEPQ is acting as a pivot._ "

6674,2020-05-28 02:31:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Agreed 
6675,2020-05-28 02:31:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","But I feel that the only time you should be using libraries is for prototypes, never for the final version of an app/website. "
6676,2020-05-28 02:31:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","This way, you aren't really using the library, but you also are ...... "
6677,2020-05-28 02:31:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Ohh Alright 
6678,2020-05-28 02:32:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",ESPECIALLY CSS/JavaScript libraries. 
6679,2020-05-28 02:32:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Oh .. 
6680,2020-05-28 02:32:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","So I should not use Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS, etc for my projects... "

6682,2020-05-28 02:33:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Oh 
6683,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Again, the decision is up to you, but I don't like to use these libraries. "
6684,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You can achieve the same outcome with 0.1% of the code. 
6685,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","And I am not even joking, try measuring code coverage in DevTools. "
6686,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",What is a CDN is used? 
6687,2020-05-28 02:34:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",If* 
6688,2020-05-28 02:35:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",We're having real talks at 2.35 AM This is fucking awesome!!!!! 
6689,2020-05-28 02:35:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",👏👏 
6690,2020-05-28 02:35:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",A CDN can only speed up the download times. 
6691,2020-05-28 02:36:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap. 
6692,2020-05-28 02:37:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",
6693,2020-05-28 02:37:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","So even if you are using a CDN, and the library is 10,000 lines, then you are only using 100-150 lines. "
6694,2020-05-28 02:38:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Which seems like a MASSIVE waste. 
6695,2020-05-28 02:38:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","It's so garbage that if I used it in my full stack project, no one would come back to it "
6696,2020-05-28 02:38:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","You sure do have a point  But what if, I say I'm not really concerned abt frontend  I don't want to waste my time adjusting padding and all etc.....  I just want to show off my backend functionality..... Then what should I do? "
6697,2020-05-28 02:38:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called? 
6698,2020-05-28 02:40:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don't use a single line. "
6699,2020-05-28 02:40:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library. "
6700,2020-05-28 02:40:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Oh yeah 🤦🏻‍♂️ 
6701,2020-05-28 02:40:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",True true 
6702,2020-05-28 02:41:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","However, there is something called ""Tree Shaking"" where unused portions of the library are removed. "
6703,2020-05-28 02:42:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library. 
6704,2020-05-28 02:42:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Ohh 
6705,2020-05-28 02:42:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And you lose the benefit of a CDN. 
6706,2020-05-28 02:43:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",? 
6707,2020-05-28 02:44:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","OK, what backend functionality? "
6708,2020-05-28 02:44:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Give me an example. 
6709,2020-05-28 02:44:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Suppose, I'm building a rest api.. "

6713,2020-05-28 02:45:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","For v2, we are making the front end ourselves and have redesigned the back end... "
6714,2020-05-28 02:47:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website. "
6715,2020-05-28 02:48:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But you can still have a great website WITHOUT BootStrap. 
6716,2020-05-28 02:48:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","Now here we are using Bootstrap and when we add Flexbox, it fucks up the Bootstrap "
6717,2020-05-28 02:48:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",No idea what should be done... 
6718,2020-05-28 02:49:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Don't use flex box.. Why do you need?? 
6719,2020-05-28 02:50:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Bootstrap handles it all na? 
6720,2020-05-28 02:54:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I try to avoid BootStrap alltogether. 
6721,2020-05-28 02:54:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Try CSS Grid. 
6722,2020-05-28 02:55:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ohh that is absolute beauty  ..... 
6723,2020-05-28 02:55:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I've used it .... 
6724,2020-05-28 02:55:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Its lengthy,  But it works... It works perfectly  It works always.... "

6726,2020-05-28 02:56:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Now, that you say it..... "

6730,2020-05-28 02:57:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",No. 
6731,2020-05-28 02:58:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Oh okay..... 
6732,2020-05-28 02:58:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Why? 
6733,2020-05-28 02:58:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Is v2 on GitHub? 
6734,2020-05-28 02:58:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Wanted to tag ya 
6735,2020-05-28 02:59:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Oh, ok. "
6736,2020-05-28 02:59:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Also, I am not sure that using a server is important. "
6737,2020-05-28 03:00:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","The advantage of not using libraries/frameworks is that the website is MUCH lighter, and hence most of the logic can be offloaded to the client. "
6738,2020-05-28 03:00:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It will greatly reduce the load on the server. 
6739,2020-05-28 03:00:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yeah... 
6740,2020-05-28 03:01:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Also, It  gives us a better understanding of what actually is happening.... "
6741,2020-05-28 03:01:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","You know, what you have coded and  That's what you are seeing... Not some pre written code, which you are using..... "

6743,2020-05-28 03:07:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","The satisfaction of finishing a project is much greater. I would say that if you feel that the only way that you can finish a project is to use a library, then go for it. But you should definitely try to do at least one project without a library. "
6744,2020-05-28 03:08:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","True! I'll complete this project, with a library, But the next one is definitely gonna be VANILLA EVERYTHING "
6745,2020-05-28 03:12:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","If you want to try vanilla, your mother's website is a great project.https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp "

6747,2020-05-28 03:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","It is better to have a long, scrolling page that has all the images instead of having 5 links that people have to click on. "
6748,2020-05-28 03:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",That is NEVER a good idea. 
6749,2020-05-28 03:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It makes it very difficult to view all the images. 
6750,2020-05-28 03:14:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ohhh 
6751,2020-05-28 03:14:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","I thought, it made things easier to view category wise..... "
6752,2020-05-28 03:15:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",If you would have only suggested me before I started! Anyways... Next time! 
6753,2020-05-28 03:16:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Yes, but if I want to view all the images, then I have to click on each link, then click 20 times on the >> button. "
6754,2020-05-28 03:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yaa.... What I'll do is..... 
6755,2020-05-28 03:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I'll create a grid of all images 
6756,2020-05-28 03:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",And 
6757,2020-05-28 03:18:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","If someone wants to see an enlarged view, I'll add something like a pop-up feature  When the user clicks on a particular image.... "
6758,2020-05-28 03:18:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Even now is not too late. 
6759,2020-05-28 03:18:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",That is exactly what I had in mind. 
6760,2020-05-28 03:18:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Like Google Images. 
6761,2020-05-28 03:18:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yeah...

6766,2020-05-28 03:20:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Also, a solid background color is quite boring. "
6767,2020-05-28 03:20:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",It's a gradient.... 
6768,2020-05-28 03:21:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",What? 
6769,2020-05-28 03:21:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yeah.... 
6770,2020-05-28 03:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Well, it looks like a solid color. "
6771,2020-05-28 03:22:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Wait 
6772,2020-05-28 03:22:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Which one are you talking about? 
6773,2020-05-28 03:22:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I'm talking about this one.... 
6774,2020-05-28 03:23:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Pick a gradient somewhere like https://uigradients.com/ . 
6775,2020-05-28 03:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Oh, I thought you were talking about https://dheerajdlalwani.github.io/ImageGallery/ "
6776,2020-05-28 03:24:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Yeah, That was old version "
6777,2020-05-28 03:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","The new one looks good, but the transitions seem a little... too flashy. "
6778,2020-05-28 03:25:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","What about a simple, left to right translate? "
6779,2020-05-28 03:25:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",That was like the first thing that popped up in Materialize CSS docs😅 
6780,2020-05-28 03:25:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I'll change it to that 
6781,2020-05-28 03:26:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Is the new website on GitHub?

6786,2020-05-28 03:27:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I'll send the link

6791,2020-05-28 03:28:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",WHY? 
6792,2020-05-28 03:28:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",It's a shop!😅 
6793,2020-05-28 03:28:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",E commerce

6795,2020-05-28 03:29:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I'll be adding payment gateways and all 
6796,2020-05-28 03:29:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",E - commerce only makes sense if you will be getting at least 10 orders per day.

6798,2020-05-28 03:29:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",😅😅

6800,2020-05-28 03:30:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It might be better to take orders via phone or email. 
6801,2020-05-28 03:30:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Hm....

6809,2020-05-28 03:33:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",If you only want to integrate with an existing provider then you might be able to use the REST api directly. 
6810,2020-05-28 03:33:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Without the need for a server.

6877,2020-06-02 00:00:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I would suggest spending at least 30 minutes on each problem.

6880,2020-06-02 00:12:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)","This can be done for interview questions as they are repetitive. But in Cp, questions aren't that repetitive. Every question has something new. That's why for cp, you have to think for an hour at least on every problem that's hard for you. People spend days solving a single question in CodeChef Long Challenge(8 questions 10 days to solve). Questions are hard. But you get learn 5-6 different concepts by solving a single question. "
6881,2020-06-02 00:14:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","This is if you're doing it for the love of CP, right? Would you recommend this for interviews as well? "

6884,2020-06-02 00:17:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)","I haven't started with interview questions yet. But yeah you should think for an hour at least. That'll improve your problem solving skills. And in interviews, they won't ask you questions which are already there on gfg(for FAANG companies). They'll always slightly change the question. To solve the question during interview you should have excellent problem solving skills. "

7062,2020-06-05 17:51:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yeahh 
7063,2020-06-05 17:51:00,+91 97681 67131,Saw re.. They are biggest scam 
7064,2020-06-05 17:52:00,+91 99693 94098,True. Mi is so shit that you have to ask for their permission for bootloader unlock and uske baad bhi you have to wait for a minimum of 15days before you can actually do it. Biggest scam ever 
7065,2020-06-05 17:53:00,+91 97681 67131,I loved their irony buying ripapple.com and rip Samsung.com and selling their refurbished phones only by rebranding them😂😂 
7066,2020-06-05 17:54:00,+91 88798 05171,But they have everything you want 
7067,2020-06-05 17:54:00,+91 97681 67131,These days I think all phones do it started by moto and Lenovo but it improves Androids privacy by having a locked bootloader it’s actually good as it makes hard to exploit a device with locked bootloader 
7068,2020-06-05 17:55:00,+91 88798 05171,There's no developement for op7 
7069,2020-06-05 17:55:00,+91 88798 05171,Its my first unrooted phone😂 
7070,2020-06-05 17:56:00,+91 99693 94098,15 days wait time for a phone that I bought? Why can't I just unlock it immediately if I want to? Your device is linked to your mi account anyway so there's no way anyone else can do it 
7071,2020-06-05 17:56:00,+91 99693 94098,There is so much development for op7 
7072,2020-06-05 17:57:00,+91 99693 94098,I know like 3-4 main devs that develop for op7 
7073,2020-06-05 17:57:00,+91 88798 05171,Thats for pro 
7074,2020-06-05 17:57:00,+91 99693 94098,Nahi nahi 
7075,2020-06-05 17:57:00,+91 88798 05171,Been a while I've checked XDA 
7076,2020-06-05 17:58:00,+91 99693 94098,Karle. Kaafi saare ROMs hai OP7 ke liye 
7077,2020-06-05 17:59:00,+91 88798 05171,Jab mene dekha tha tab lineage tak nahi tha 
7078,2020-06-05 18:01:00,+91 99693 94098,I know op7 ka PE dev. Baalaji. He used to develop for my device before 
7079,2020-06-05 18:01:00,+91 97681 67131,Moto and pixel give code immediately though. See bootloader is a integral part of os without its correct flashing device does not work. If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that’s the reason locked bootloader are better 
7080,2020-06-05 18:02:00,+91 97681 67131,Lineage OS surely would be there as lots of old CYnogen mod developers working on lineage OS and one plus and cynogen go way back 
7081,2020-06-05 18:04:00,+91 88798 05171,"tele group nikal na op7 ka, xda doesnt even have an official lineage thread "
7082,2020-06-05 18:04:00,+91 99693 94098,"I know this re 😂😂 I'm saying that all phones have a security check before you can unlock(some kind of login or something) so no random person can do it. If you're giving your login credentials and you're still not able to unlock the bootloader immediately then what's the use?  Flashing a custom recovery, etc comes much later. ADB doesn't allow that anyway before you unlock the bootlader "

7084,2020-06-05 18:06:00,+91 99693 94098,Infact I know this guy as well. Pro dev hai 😂😂 
7085,2020-06-05 18:06:00,+91 97681 67131,Ya... now providing what moto calls unique key for bootloader unlocking that’s up to manufacturer re. Before doing that they have too check if device has valid purchase date etc now moto does it on site and gives code immediately I have never tried on mi device that’s issue with xiomi 
7086,2020-06-05 18:07:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Shit going above head again 😂 
7087,2020-06-05 18:07:00,+91 99693 94098,That's much better imo 
7088,2020-06-05 18:07:00,+91 88798 05171,1 saal hogaya twrp nahi dekha hoga 
7089,2020-06-05 18:07:00,+91 99693 94098,Try orangefox if your device has it. 10x better than twrp 
7090,2020-06-05 18:07:00,+91 88798 05171,ye kab aaya😂 
7091,2020-06-05 18:07:00,+91 97681 67131,?

7093,2020-06-05 18:08:00,+91 88798 05171,might be a recovery 
7094,2020-06-05 18:08:00,+91 99693 94098,Rip I guess op7 doesn't have it 
7095,2020-06-05 18:08:00,+91 99693 94098,Yes 
7096,2020-06-05 18:08:00,+91 97681 67131,It would have pixel experience rom see that’s a lot popular on one plus devices these days 
7097,2020-06-05 18:09:00,+91 99693 94098,It's literally one step away from being a ROM itself 😂😂 Bas wifi and data connectivity daalde and done

7109,2020-06-05 18:13:00,+91 97681 67131,They don’t care truly and actually btw safari has web inspector on Mac though not as good as chrome developer tools nowhere near actually 😂😂😂 
7110,2020-06-05 18:15:00,+91 88798 05171,pe has v limited customisations na 
7111,2020-06-05 18:16:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I like the design of the FireFox devtools more. But Chrome devtools has some great features. 
7112,2020-06-05 18:16:00,+91 99693 94098,Yes. Like Lineage 
7113,2020-06-05 18:17:00,+91 88798 05171,not for me then 
7114,2020-06-05 18:17:00,+91 99693 94098,Apparently Henrique ported face unlock for Q from some moto phone and moto sent him a notice 😂😂 Uske baad se abhi koi moto ke phones ko bhaav nahi de raha 
7115,2020-06-05 18:18:00,+91 97681 67131,Yup.. chrome is best Never tried Firefox accept on all Linux distros 
7116,2020-06-05 18:20:00,+91 97681 67131,I know... issue with moto is that only walls are built very high I was reading this article on sim unlocking on moto USA devices apparently I guy wrote a python script that gave the unique key for such device and was sued by moto.. he stoped now

7261,2020-06-10 18:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",What GUI?

7269,2020-06-10 18:25:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Explain this is simple terms lol 
7270,2020-06-10 18:29:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Windows has an in-built mechanic to check activation with *any* Key Management Server (KMS). This is usually used in corporate enviorments where internet access is a security issue. But you can setup a KMS server ON THE SAME PC and Windows will happily ask the server if the liscence is still valid. 
7271,2020-06-10 18:30:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Is it like piracy?

7276,2020-06-10 18:32:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Yes, but you are not modifying the software, just using in-built mechanisms in un-intended ways. "
7277,2020-06-10 18:32:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Ironically it is hosted on GitHub😂😂 
7278,2020-06-10 18:33:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Yes. But not a lot of people know about this or have the patience to read the README. 
7279,2020-06-10 18:34:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",😅 
7280,2020-06-10 18:50:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","That will be VERY difficult, since Microsoft mainly relys on the backwords-compatibility of Windows. Otherwise all businesses would have switched to Linux. "

7328,2020-06-12 22:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","Dude why don't you use an IDE like IntelliJ ,it will be easier to debug then "
7329,2020-06-12 22:25:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",int x is not declared 
7330,2020-06-12 22:25:00,"Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE)",X is not defined inside prime 
7331,2020-06-12 22:25:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes 
7332,2020-06-12 22:36:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Actually, he is doing a great job. "
7333,2020-06-12 22:37:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes getting used to command line...but as a beginner better to use an IDE like BlueJ 
7334,2020-06-12 22:38:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",But no one is going to tell you that their should be written in a notepad or something 
7335,2020-06-12 22:38:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","I too like to use the command line for simple programs, but USE AN EDITOR. Notepad++ is a good standalone editor. So is VSCode. But DON'T USE NOTEPAD. "
7336,2020-06-12 22:39:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",True 
7337,2020-06-12 22:40:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",IDE's help you a lot!!! 
7338,2020-06-12 22:43:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Exactly  You don't want the beginner to get too much help 
7339,2020-06-12 22:44:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Then you use Bluej 
7340,2020-06-12 22:44:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","Its just perfect,just like a text editor,no auto-complete "
7341,2020-06-12 22:46:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Why??🙄😶 
7342,2020-06-12 22:46:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","The beginner should be able to figure it out himself, where he went wrong  Rather than the ide just helping him fix the errors "
7343,2020-06-12 22:47:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Ide does show you the errors 
7344,2020-06-12 22:53:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",And getting stuck at such a trivial issues is so demotivating for a beginner 
7345,2020-06-12 22:54:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",This is true 
7346,2020-06-12 23:04:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","I know  Been there.... But,  I also used an IDE only.... "
7347,2020-06-12 23:05:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","But I realized, in order to get perfect.... I would have done better if I had done it on a simple text editor "
7348,2020-06-12 23:05:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Do watch Tech With Tim's video on this topic 
7349,2020-06-12 23:06:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",https://youtu.be/oij82Cp9K1A 
7350,2020-06-12 23:07:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I feel that  Immediate help is harmful 
7351,2020-06-12 23:07:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Notepad++ provides only syntax highlighting. I think that is a quite helpfully, especially for a beginner. "
7352,2020-06-12 23:08:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","Bluej is the best for beginners imo,we used that in school too "
7353,2020-06-12 23:09:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Not using an IDE is like learning to ride a bike without training wheels. Yes, it is possible but there is no major benefit. "
7354,2020-06-12 23:14:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",True that 
7355,2020-06-12 23:17:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Which language? 
7356,2020-06-12 23:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Python 
7357,2020-06-12 23:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",C++ 
7358,2020-06-12 23:19:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I find Python impossible to code without an IDE. Especially without a mononspace font. I really don't like the syntax. 
7359,2020-06-12 23:19:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ahh I know that😅😅 
7360,2020-06-12 23:20:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Python have a really steep learning curve for people from another language which have brackets 
7361,2020-06-12 23:21:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",It's very hard to get used to those whitespaces 
7362,2020-06-12 23:21:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Its not just the whitespaces, Python has vary strange behaviour. "
7363,2020-06-12 23:21:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",*very. 
7364,2020-06-12 23:22:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Ik😂 
7365,2020-06-12 23:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","I cannot do ```""I have "" + 5 + "" Apples""```. "
7366,2020-06-12 23:22:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",🤣 
7367,2020-06-12 23:23:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But I call a function with missing arguments? 
7368,2020-06-12 23:23:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",😂😂 
7369,2020-06-12 23:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Im uncomfortable with Python syntax fr🤣 
7370,2020-06-12 23:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",JAVA ALLOWS THIS. C++ ALLOWS THIS. BOTH ARE MORE STRONGLY TYPED THAN PYTHON. 
7371,2020-06-12 23:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And initializing multi-dimension arrays is horrible. 
7372,2020-06-12 23:24:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",If you are using a statically typed language ide helps a lot 
7373,2020-06-12 23:25:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",If you are using a ~statically typed~ language ide helps a lot. 
7374,2020-06-12 23:26:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",And i can't find a reason of not using an ide if you are always going to use an ide 
7375,2020-06-12 23:26:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Y'all, hating python so much makes me sad  🥺🥺 👉🏻👈🏻👉🏻👈🏻 "
7376,2020-06-12 23:27:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Python has a statement to do nothing. 
7377,2020-06-12 23:27:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Aww we don't hate you😂 
7378,2020-06-12 23:27:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Watch the video 
7379,2020-06-12 23:27:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",.

7383,2020-06-12 23:27:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Idk why but I really hate Python 
7384,2020-06-12 23:28:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Dream come true😂 Now, to do nothing also, I'm accounted for 😂 "
7385,2020-06-12 23:28:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Another disadvantage that its Dynamically typed

7389,2020-06-12 23:30:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yeah... 
7390,2020-06-12 23:30:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",On codeforces 
7391,2020-06-12 23:30:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",I never wrote a line of code without an ide but still ik what error I'm getting. What i feel is that learning a language takes time but demotivating yourself of by getting stuck at simple issues is not acceptable. 
7392,2020-06-12 23:31:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Yes 
7393,2020-06-12 23:31:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It is less about the error and more about knowing how to work with simple tools. 
7394,2020-06-12 23:32:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",I gave example of error 
7395,2020-06-12 23:32:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Syntax highlighting is necessary  But,  Autocomplete nahi yaar... I've grown so used to it That  I keep forgetting the syntax "

7397,2020-06-12 23:35:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Its a nightmare to read the logs 
7398,2020-06-12 23:36:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Ganda hai par dhanda hai😂😂

7409,2020-06-12 23:40:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Then, couple that with the autocomplete "
7410,2020-06-12 23:41:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",This makes it faster 
7411,2020-06-12 23:41:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Couple the practice with autocomplete  Your efficiency increases ×3 
7412,2020-06-12 23:41:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Exactly

7421,2020-06-12 23:43:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Bhai but you will always have autocomplete

We’ll start with v basic projects starting from Python ke basics and will go on aage (ITS OKAY IF YOU DON’T KNOW MUCH WE ALL ARE LEARNING HERE )   - we will refer to 1YouTube video focusing on 1 project for a week and try to make and learn on our own .  - if we don’t understand any concept or anything from the video we’lltry to reverse engineer it and help others in the group as well.

8165,2020-06-28 21:23:00,+91 75078 05454,This looks interesting. But it looks like a customisable yet limited platform specifically created for development of apps for internal business use something like a project management app. 
8166,2020-06-28 21:25:00,+91 75078 05454,It's an interesting move of Amazon's part. They are trying to migrate people who are using Google docs or microsoft excel to this platform which is powered by AWS. 
8167,2020-06-28 21:25:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",How exactly/ 
8168,2020-06-28 21:26:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","This is an app development platform, right? "
8169,2020-06-28 21:26:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Not an Excel or Google Sheets clone. 
8170,2020-06-28 21:29:00,+91 75078 05454,Businesses use spreadsheets for managing projects that is what they are trying to replace. 
8171,2020-06-28 21:29:00,+91 75078 05454,Not something like data analysis or financial analysis done using spreadsheets 
8172,2020-06-28 21:33:00,+91 75078 05454,They are basically trying to solve the problem of using spreadsheets where they are not supposed to be conventionally used . 
8173,2020-06-28 21:33:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","OK, that makes some sense. "
8174,2020-06-28 21:36:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",👍👍 
8175,2020-06-28 21:37:00,"Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE)",Never thought would see this day😂 
8176,2020-06-28 21:39:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",*Some* sense. I am still not completely sure if that is the real goal. 
8177,2020-06-28 21:39:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",😂 
8178,2020-06-28 21:40:00,+91 80979 84068,😂

8180,2020-06-28 21:53:00,+91 75078 05454,😂 
8181,2020-06-28 21:53:00,+91 75078 05454,What is your opinion? 
8182,2020-06-28 22:02:00,+91 75078 05454,The real goal is definitely not to be an excel clone but to provide an effective way of creating apps for internal operations 
8183,2020-06-28 22:03:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",My point exactly. 
8184,2020-06-28 22:04:00,+91 75078 05454,But they are going to have a huge advantage once the entire company moves to their platform for all internal operations 
8185,2020-06-28 22:04:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","While this is certainly possible, I don't think that this is the first use-case to come to mind. "
8186,2020-06-28 22:05:00,+91 75078 05454,? 
8187,2020-06-28 22:07:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","I mean that it is possible to do data-analysis and manage projects on the platform, but that is not what I would use the platform for. "
8188,2020-06-28 22:08:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I would use it for rapid prototypes and proof of concepts. 
8189,2020-06-28 22:08:00,+91 75078 05454,That's definitely a very good use case but depends on the capability of the platform 
8190,2020-06-28 22:09:00,+91 75078 05454,From their campaign it looks like a platform for making apps for internal operations for businesses 
8191,2020-06-28 22:10:00,+91 75078 05454,But there is definitely a possibility of that turning into something like WordPress 
8192,2020-06-28 22:11:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I feel that Wordpress gained it's popularity because it was so open. 
8193,2020-06-28 22:12:00,+91 75078 05454,That's what I am saying the range of use cases will depend upon the flexibility of the platform 
8194,2020-06-28 22:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",That is true. 
8195,2020-06-28 22:14:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But I don't think that companies will be willing to trust Amazon with their business logic. 
8196,2020-06-28 22:15:00,+91 75078 05454,Yeah that's true 
8197,2020-06-28 23:36:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Same. Even I was surprised when I read that 😂 Kartik is awesome though! 
8198,2020-06-29 00:33:00,+91 97739 65140,"So, basically they are trying to make slack premium version?😅 "
8199,2020-06-29 00:33:00,+91 97739 65140,With more features 
8200,2020-06-29 00:33:00,+91 97739 65140,And no outside app integration 
8201,2020-06-29 00:54:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","But it's free, right? "

8290,2020-07-01 17:14:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",F aaisa kya kar raha hai? 
8291,2020-07-01 17:14:00,+91 75078 05454,Yeh competition ka question hai naa? 
8292,2020-07-01 17:15:00,+91 73043 57388,Yes 
8293,2020-07-01 17:15:00,+91 73043 57388,Actually i am getting  Only 5 numbers after . Point 
8294,2020-07-01 17:16:00,+91 75078 05454,I tried by importing Decimal in python 
8295,2020-07-01 17:16:00,+91 99204 26955,try fixed and set precision I guess 
8296,2020-07-01 17:17:00,+91 73043 57388,Ya but it seems they are only used while printing a double number  I wanna store number

8298,2020-07-01 17:17:00,+91 75078 05454,I converted it to a string 
8299,2020-07-01 17:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",You will have to use arrays. 
8300,2020-07-01 17:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Or a string. 
8301,2020-07-01 17:17:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",hmm 
8302,2020-07-01 17:21:00,+91 73043 57388,Yes we will convert it to a string but first the numbers p and q are divided then their result is stored in string 
8303,2020-07-01 17:22:00,+91 73043 57388,I even used long double but still doesn't getting more than 5 digits 
8304,2020-07-01 17:26:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",You will have to do the division process in small small steps 
8305,2020-07-01 17:27:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",And store the number decimal by decimal by appending the string. 
8306,2020-07-01 17:28:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",There was a similar problem on code chef Where you had to find the factorial of numbers > 21  Suppose you have to calculate 100! 
8307,2020-07-01 17:28:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",You have to write a special algorithm for division 
8308,2020-07-01 17:28:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",correct 
8309,2020-07-01 17:29:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",simulate the division process 
8310,2020-07-01 17:29:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I have the solution for this. You can read and then write the required algorithm for division. 
8311,2020-07-01 17:29:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yess. 
8312,2020-07-01 17:29:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",and keep adding

8519,2020-07-06 19:26:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It would be better if you can tell us what exactly you are trying to do. 
8520,2020-07-06 20:15:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","I'm trying to create tables.  For example, if I do it normally, in MySQL, I can use foreign key to links 2 tables.  I want to understand  How to do that using classes in Python.   But, never mind, I'll look it up and experiment so that, understand. "
8521,2020-07-06 20:16:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","I was looking for a shortcut, like if someone has done it, I would have just asked how, but I'll do it on my own only.  Thanks anyways 😅 "
8522,2020-07-06 20:59:00,"Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE)","There is a field called ForeignKey in django models, which works exactly like the Foreign key in SQL "

8525,2020-07-06 23:18:00,+91 82916 21138,Actually semicolon is used to end a query.

8533,2020-07-07 01:48:00,Tushar Nankani,This type of regex probably means it should start with _aeiou._ 
8534,2020-07-07 01:51:00,Tushar Nankani,And it should probably be ```^[aeiou]```. I am not too sure.

8562,2020-07-07 21:19:00,"Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE)",I think you get that for interactive problems 
8563,2020-07-07 21:20:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah when the program doesn't output anything 
8564,2020-07-07 21:21:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Idleness limit exceeded occurs when your program stays idle (waiting for user/interaction program) for long time.  I'm not sure why is it not WA instead of Idleness limit exceeded. My guess is that interaction program expects a newline and thus keeps on waiting for your program.

8705,2020-07-10 17:12:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",.01 don't make much difference

8710,2020-07-10 17:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Depends. You should read the changelog and see if new features were added. 
8711,2020-07-10 17:13:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",will check 
8712,2020-07-10 17:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",For example git sparse-checkout was added in a 0.1 update. 
8713,2020-07-10 17:13:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",oh 
8714,2020-07-10 17:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And so was git switch and git restore. 
8715,2020-07-10 17:14:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Yaa but most of the time .01 is likely to be a bug fix 
8716,2020-07-10 17:14:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Yes, most of the time it is true. "
8717,2020-07-10 17:15:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But somtimes features are added/changed from experimental to stable. 
8718,2020-07-10 17:15:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Best way is to read the changelog.

8745,2020-07-10 19:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Similar to apt and apk. 
8746,2020-07-10 19:22:00,+91 97681 67131,Package manager like Linux has apt... 
8747,2020-07-10 19:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Exactly. 
8748,2020-07-10 19:23:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It is also availiable for linux. 
8749,2020-07-10 19:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","It has limited use, except in very rare situations. One thing it does differently is it installs all software to the USER's partition instead of system. "
8750,2020-07-10 19:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Means you don't have to be root to install software. 
8751,2020-07-10 19:25:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","You can ""isolate"" brew to one directory and it will not touch anything outside that directory. "
8752,2020-07-10 19:25:00,+91 97681 67131,Are u trying to install git?? That’s why asking for home brew? For example if I needed to install git on OS X u can use home brew as ur package manager. This will automatically install all the Xcode command line tools recquired for git to run on ur mac 
8753,2020-07-10 19:26:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah 
8754,2020-07-10 19:26:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Oh acha 
8755,2020-07-10 19:28:00,+91 97681 67131,"Thought so, I also did the same recently 😅. Anyway, instead of manually installing full Xcode and command line tools, this package manager will only install the needed libraries for vcs system like git to work on OS X "
8756,2020-07-10 19:28:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I think you can just do ```git``` on the command line and it will propmpt for installation.

8760,2020-07-10 19:28:00,+91 97681 67131,I don’t think that works in terminal on OSX 
8761,2020-07-10 19:29:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",not only git i did 'brew install git'

8764,2020-07-10 19:31:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",then through terminal i did brew install git 
8765,2020-07-10 19:32:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)","but it seems ki when you install Xcode , git gets installed too "
8766,2020-07-10 19:32:00,+91 97681 67131,"Oh then do u have Xcode installed and before that pls check software update section, command line tools installing happens from there... "
8767,2020-07-10 19:32:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah i have Xcode 
8768,2020-07-10 19:33:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Software update section? 
8769,2020-07-10 19:33:00,+91 97681 67131,"Nope it’s not needed to install Xcode just command line tools are necessary mostly but check software update section, they are installed from there "

8771,2020-07-10 19:34:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",It just shows Your mac is up to date 
8772,2020-07-10 19:35:00,+91 97681 67131,Try running git—version command is it giving back any version or no ?? If not I think some installing issue.. I will find tutorial I used. 
8773,2020-07-10 19:36:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah it gives the version number 
8774,2020-07-10 19:36:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",git is installed 
8775,2020-07-10 19:36:00,+91 97681 67131,Then it’s installed 
8776,2020-07-10 19:36:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",just wanted to know about Home Brew 
8777,2020-07-10 19:36:00,+91 97681 67131,Oh 😂 Ya oh I thought stuck with installing 
8778,2020-07-10 19:37:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",loll 
8779,2020-07-10 19:37:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",XCode has old packages sometimes. Note that the latest git version is 2.27.0. 
8780,2020-07-10 19:38:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",I'll check 
8781,2020-07-10 19:38:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",just a sec 
8782,2020-07-10 19:38:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yup its 2.27.0 
8783,2020-07-10 19:38:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Great! 
8784,2020-07-10 19:39:00,+91 97681 67131,"Homebrew is just a command line package manager like Kartik and I said what we have in in Linux, like apt, debians dpkg etc "
8785,2020-07-10 19:39:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Thanks @918080142783 and @919768167131 !

8789,2020-07-10 19:39:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",No problem. 
8790,2020-07-10 19:40:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Just a side note, dpkg is just a package installer, it will not download dependencies. "
8791,2020-07-10 19:40:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",apt uses dpkg internally. 
8792,2020-07-10 19:40:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",It went over my head lol 
8793,2020-07-10 19:40:00,+91 97681 67131,Ya ya.. it’s installer sorry 
8794,2020-07-10 19:42:00,+91 97681 67131,But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right?? 
8795,2020-07-10 19:43:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies. But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order. "
8796,2020-07-10 19:43:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager. "

9099,2020-07-19 14:10:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Why? 
9100,2020-07-19 14:10:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Just remove the app from settings 
9101,2020-07-19 14:11:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",You will have to create a new project though 🤷🏻‍♂️ Migrate data and delete the old one 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
9102,2020-07-19 14:11:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Oh and block all requests for now through security rules

9109,2020-07-19 14:13:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",App ID is which is Imp just look that after re adding the app app ID is changed 
9110,2020-07-19 14:13:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",So you mean that a new project need not be created? 
9111,2020-07-19 14:14:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Yes if app id is changed that u don't need to do make new project 
9112,2020-07-19 14:14:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Ok then 
9113,2020-07-19 14:15:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Will have connect it again😓 
9114,2020-07-19 14:15:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Very painful process as Android studio does a lot of nautanki

9120,2020-07-19 14:16:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Do this till then 
9121,2020-07-19 14:17:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",If I make a new project then code will still be the same right? 
9122,2020-07-19 14:17:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Only thing which important is app ID and API key 
9123,2020-07-19 14:17:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Only I will have to set up the connection again? 
9124,2020-07-19 14:18:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Yeah and migrate app data in Firebase (idk how it's done though)

9202,2020-07-22 17:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",```int largestPrimeFactor(int n){     if(n <= 3)         return n;          int f = 1;     while(n > 1){         f++;         while(n % f == 0)             n /= f;     }          return f; }``` 
9203,2020-07-22 17:23:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You have to add logic to handle 0 and negative numbers. 
9204,2020-07-22 17:26:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",``` vector<int> divs; int check(int x) {     if(x <= 1) return -1;          for (int i = 2; i * i <= x ; ++i) {         if(x%i == 0) {            divs.push_back(i);            while(x % i == 0) {                x = x / i;            }         }     }          if(divs.empty())divs.push_back(x);          return divs.back(); }```

9211,2020-07-22 17:30:00,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",your loop will run 10^9 + 7 times

9494,2020-08-07 14:14:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",So write a function to take the json data and create the required markup. 
9495,2020-08-07 14:14:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Have a for loop in the templating syntax that you're using and then add the necessary data in that

9543,2020-08-10 11:58:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",If you are on wifi enable port forwarding

9616,2020-08-11 20:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Oh 
9617,2020-08-11 20:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Maybe because its very popular and easy to learn 
9618,2020-08-11 20:26:00,+91 98337 26449,It still puts you in their radar. Or else they would've completely canned it. 
9619,2020-08-11 20:26:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Yeah maybe. 
9620,2020-08-11 20:56:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Google is shifting from java because it have some licensing issues 
9621,2020-08-11 20:57:00,+91 82916 21138,Yeah I heard this too 
9622,2020-08-11 20:58:00,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",It was a stupid move by Oracle imo. They're killing off Java... 
9623,2020-08-11 20:59:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",And Flutter can never replace native...it is true google is try to push kotlin through it. 
9624,2020-08-11 21:02:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes 
9625,2020-08-11 21:03:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",But the fuchsia OS will be totally flutter based right!? 
9626,2020-08-11 21:08:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Will it be able to take over most popular OS? 
9627,2020-08-11 21:10:00,+91 82916 21138,🤔 interesting question tbh maybe I heard they are filling all gaps of android and making it 
9628,2020-08-11 21:12:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",I have already told this but think of replacing millions of android devices 
9629,2020-08-11 21:20:00,+91 82916 21138,Yeah  it will be gradual process but still 😅 maybe fuchsia becomes new update of android and from there on things change or something like that 🤔 
9630,2020-08-11 21:20:00,+91 82916 21138,Like android has already started removing some stuff 
9631,2020-08-11 21:21:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",This can never happen... 
9632,2020-08-11 21:21:00,+91 82916 21138,Yeah ik 
9633,2020-08-11 21:22:00,+91 82916 21138,I mean android is changing although so maybe idk who knows the future 😅 
9634,2020-08-11 21:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Just don't want to be with an obsolete skill thats it😅😂 
9635,2020-08-11 21:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",I mean native android dev 
9636,2020-08-11 21:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",What if it becomes obsolete at the end of 4 years 
9637,2020-08-11 21:23:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Changing a os means bye bye to your data 
9638,2020-08-11 21:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes 
9639,2020-08-11 21:23:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Nhi hoga bhai 
9640,2020-08-11 21:23:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",🙏🙏 
9641,2020-08-11 21:24:00,+91 82916 21138,Haa 
9642,2020-08-11 21:24:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Android 4.4 bhi use kar rahe hai log 😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 
9643,2020-08-11 21:24:00,+91 82916 21138,Yeah ik but I mean  they will declare last version of android and then declare after this it will be Fuchsian 
9644,2020-08-11 21:25:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",No not gonna happen 
9645,2020-08-11 21:25:00,+91 82916 21138,Like and Android's last version might look similar to Fuchsian maybe  kind of like that so smooth switch 🤔 
9646,2020-08-11 21:25:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Leaving support for millions of devices is not simple and thing they can do as a company 
9647,2020-08-11 21:25:00,+91 82916 21138,True 
9648,2020-08-11 21:26:00,+91 82916 21138,🤔 yeah true thing but what I read is that they are planning to make something which all iot device etc can use etc so don't know 
9649,2020-08-11 21:27:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Kaha se aate aise idea? 
9650,2020-08-11 21:27:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Most definately not. 
9651,2020-08-11 21:27:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You can change you OS without loosing your data. 
9652,2020-08-11 21:27:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",As long as it is implemented properly. 
9653,2020-08-11 21:27:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",If I flash a custom rom for it's recommended for a clean flash 
9654,2020-08-11 21:28:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",**recommended** 
9655,2020-08-11 21:29:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And that is because they don't know what your previous OS was. 
9656,2020-08-11 21:29:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Yaa i tried not to and it gave me errors while boot so i did a clean flash 
9657,2020-08-11 21:29:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",9 to 10 and the stock was released on 9 
9658,2020-08-11 21:30:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","If you know which OS the phone is running, and you have can push (signed) OTA updates, you can do almost anything. "
9659,2020-08-11 21:30:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Again, this is a custom rom. "
9660,2020-08-11 21:30:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Don't you think fuchsia will have totally different file structure and permissions? 
9661,2020-08-11 21:31:00,+91 82916 21138,🤔 maybe true 
9662,2020-08-11 21:32:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes can be 
9663,2020-08-11 21:32:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Even if they do, it is trivial to copy over all data from the old locations to the new one. "
9664,2020-08-11 21:32:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",App data? 
9665,2020-08-11 21:32:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Fuchsia won't be Linux based right? 
9666,2020-08-11 21:32:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Now app data, I agree, will be quite difficult to port. "
9667,2020-08-11 21:33:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",And will OEMs will do it😂🤦‍♂️ 
9668,2020-08-11 21:33:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","But most apps backup to the cloud anyways, so 🤷‍♂️ "
9669,2020-08-11 21:33:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",I still don't have officially Android 10🤦‍♂️ 
9670,2020-08-11 21:34:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",You rooted your phone for android 10!?

9675,2020-08-11 21:34:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",You can't support only *some* apps 
9676,2020-08-11 21:34:00,+91 82916 21138,🤦‍♂️🤣XDA forum ? 
9677,2020-08-11 21:34:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Even if they don't save to cloud, you can usually export settings to a file. "

9679,2020-08-11 21:35:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",But you can still get the former OS right

9729,2020-08-11 21:46:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",XDA and community both couldn't help ne with this😂🤦‍♂️ 
9730,2020-08-11 21:46:00,+91 99693 94098,Did you try overwriting the recovery partition? 
9731,2020-08-11 21:46:00,+91 82916 21138,I had put another os in my old phone using XDA twrp use kiya usse phele phone unlock Kiya and Kiya mast clear Kiya etc 
9732,2020-08-11 21:46:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Your juna tab? 
9733,2020-08-11 21:47:00,+91 82916 21138,Yes old tab and my friends phone also I did the same 
9734,2020-08-11 21:47:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Lol 
9735,2020-08-11 21:47:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",So the mistake i did was that twrp didn't supported restore for android 10 and without knowing this is tried to restore app data 
9736,2020-08-11 21:48:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",So you can't get android 10 in anyway? 
9737,2020-08-11 21:48:00,+91 82916 21138,I had put resurrection remix 
9738,2020-08-11 21:48:00,+91 82916 21138,Haa twrp plays tweaks like that 
9739,2020-08-11 21:49:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",You can why not? 
9740,2020-08-11 21:49:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",But why you couldn't? didn't get it? 
9741,2020-08-11 21:49:00,+91 99693 94098,"Big F. Should've used a compatible twrp. If you could overwrite the recovery with a compatible version, you could've fixed the issue "
9742,2020-08-11 21:49:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Did you lose all app data? 
9743,2020-08-11 21:50:00,+91 99693 94098,Android 10 has scoped storage so you can't directly shift data 
9744,2020-08-11 21:50:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Oh 
9745,2020-08-11 21:50:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Again you couldn't execute any command in fastboot... this was first thing that i tried 
9746,2020-08-11 21:50:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","I want to try to go from Android 6 to Android 10 on my old phone,will definitely try😂 "

9748,2020-08-11 21:52:00,+91 99693 94098,"I'm not sure about the zenfone tbh but there are fastboot roms. That would be my first step actually. Anyway, as long as you got it fixed 😂🙌🏼 "
9749,2020-08-11 21:53:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Basically driver files. 
9750,2020-08-11 21:53:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Fastboot roms?

9752,2020-08-11 21:55:00,+91 99693 94098,Fastboot flashable ROMs. As I said I'm not sure of zenfone but devices like samsung and miui have Odin and miui flash tool 
9753,2020-08-11 21:56:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",I tried the official asus flash toolkit but it required to run in fastboot 
9754,2020-08-11 21:56:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",But I can't execute any commands on fastboot🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 
9755,2020-08-11 21:56:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",WHAT? 
9756,2020-08-11 21:56:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Then what have I been using??? 
9757,2020-08-11 21:57:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Idk😂 
9758,2020-08-11 21:59:00,+91 99693 94098,It's a bit different than a simple fastboot command but it's fine 
9759,2020-08-11 22:01:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Now the have locked my fastboot i might reflash the stock rom and restore the original fastboot file and again flash a custom rom😂😅🤦‍♂️

9766,2020-08-11 22:11:00,Tushar Nankani,1TB SATA is 1 TB SSD? 
9767,2020-08-11 22:12:00,Tushar Nankani,"According to what I have read, for gaming laptops, 512 SSD and 4 GB graphic card would work the best. "
9768,2020-08-11 22:12:00,"Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS)",Wait I am confused. What I have seen mostly are the ones with 1TB hddand 256 GB SSD.  This one laptop says 1TB SATA 
9769,2020-08-11 22:12:00,"Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS)",Sata is ssd? 
9770,2020-08-11 22:14:00,+91 77180 82108,Gaming laptops are not worth the money 
9771,2020-08-11 22:14:00,+91 77180 82108,Go for a PC instead 
9772,2020-08-11 22:14:00,+91 88798 05171,No 
9773,2020-08-11 22:14:00,+91 77180 82108,SATA is an interface

9820,2020-08-13 14:27:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","I really dk why such stuff is being taught to us, instead theu could teach Graphics in Python/Java "
9821,2020-08-13 14:28:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",C/C++ is used for system programming 
9822,2020-08-13 14:29:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Do you know how Graphics are drawn in Python/Java? 
9823,2020-08-13 14:29:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It ultimately falls back to C/C++ 
9824,2020-08-13 14:29:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Would like to 😛 
9825,2020-08-13 14:29:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",By converting in C/C++

9829,2020-08-13 14:30:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Nah bro Even paint and all built using C/C++ I heard 
9830,2020-08-13 14:30:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",How do you think Python Was built ? 
9831,2020-08-13 14:30:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Ha but do we really have to rebuild the wheel🤔 
9832,2020-08-13 14:30:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes bro C/C++ are base of all languages I understand 
9833,2020-08-13 14:31:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","No, but you should understand how the wheel works. "

9835,2020-08-13 14:31:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",True but....turbo C++ use karna zaroori hai uske liye😂 
9836,2020-08-13 14:31:00,+91 75078 05454,we should be learning 3d graphics using opengl or something 
9837,2020-08-13 14:31:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",C++ 
9838,2020-08-13 14:32:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",That I agree with. 
9839,2020-08-13 14:32:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",C# 
9840,2020-08-13 14:32:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yeah 
9841,2020-08-13 14:32:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But after basic graphics. 
9842,2020-08-13 14:32:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",graphics.h is obsolete right? 
9843,2020-08-13 14:32:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",We use C# while building games But The actual Engine  Unity is built using C++

9851,2020-08-13 14:33:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",@918080142783 if they are doing graphics cpp and their libraries are old then how morden languages are using it? 
9852,2020-08-13 14:34:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Like are they modifying it or something else? 
9853,2020-08-13 14:34:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Again, graphics.h is depricated because modern processors support SIMD. "
9854,2020-08-13 14:34:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Or calling its methods internally 
9855,2020-08-13 14:34:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Oh

10521,2020-08-25 22:31:00,+91 82916 21138,Actually it's because it has been this way for many years and we see very less people doing things out of box cause we are always told 10th karlo life set hai then jee karlo set hai but no-one talks of skills

10580,2020-08-26 12:04:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",VSCode has too much hand-holding. 
10581,2020-08-26 12:04:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",I'm writing java in notepad++😂 
10582,2020-08-26 12:04:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",But hamesha using notepad is stupidity

10592,2020-08-26 12:05:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Again, too much autocomplete. "

10615,2020-08-26 12:08:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Notepad++ opens in like 300 ms. 
10616,2020-08-26 12:08:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",R u talking about command line vim?

10627,2020-08-26 12:09:00,+91 97681 67131,I started on that only 
10628,2020-08-26 12:09:00,+91 97681 67131,Google 
10629,2020-08-26 12:09:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But that might get harder with Apple Silicone. 
10630,2020-08-26 12:10:00,+91 97681 67131,Ya true 😂 
10631,2020-08-26 12:10:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Bhai support hardware toh ho😂

10633,2020-08-26 12:10:00,+91 97681 67131,Arm architecture.. 
10634,2020-08-26 12:10:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Windows ❤️ 
10635,2020-08-26 12:10:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Virtualbox. 
10636,2020-08-26 12:10:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Docker? 
10637,2020-08-26 12:10:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",I would better use windows😂 
10638,2020-08-26 12:10:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Or Linux 
10639,2020-08-26 12:10:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Hypervisor? 
10640,2020-08-26 12:10:00,+91 97681 67131,This is kinda useless until have a good specked laptop u can’t really run Xcode simulator completely I tried a lot.. 
10641,2020-08-26 12:10:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But I am skeptical about long term feasibility. 
10642,2020-08-26 12:11:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Noooooo 🤦‍♂️ 
10643,2020-08-26 12:11:00,+91 97681 67131,So last resort hackintosh... though driver support is pathetic 😂 
10644,2020-08-26 12:11:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You have completely missed the point. 
10645,2020-08-26 12:11:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Yes as Microsoft is also pushing arm now 
10646,2020-08-26 12:12:00,+91 97681 67131,Nope I guess they might just have it I was watching WWDC 2020 Rosetta 2 seems promising 
10647,2020-08-26 12:12:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Pushing arm is not the issue. (Arm actually has better performance for lower price) 
10648,2020-08-26 12:12:00,+91 97681 67131,They can’t make it happen for that u need control over hardware as well 
10649,2020-08-26 12:12:00,+91 97681 67131,They failed once remember snapdragon 835 laptop 
10650,2020-08-26 12:12:00,+91 88284 70904,Mai sublime mai likha kuch bola nahi lol😂 
10651,2020-08-26 12:12:00,+91 86559 19035,And lower thermals 
10652,2020-08-26 12:13:00,+91 97681 67131,Windows ka some hp or Lenovo built in 2018 ig 
10653,2020-08-26 12:13:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",They are partnering with Qualcomm for chipset and supporting them 
10654,2020-08-26 12:13:00,+91 86559 19035,Doesn't mean always 
10655,2020-08-26 12:13:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",+1 
10656,2020-08-26 12:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",The only reason big companies (Adobe/Autodesk) write hight performance software for Macs is because it is 99% similiar to Windows. 
10657,2020-08-26 12:13:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",So the extra effort is justified. 
10658,2020-08-26 12:14:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",(And almost negligible) 
10659,2020-08-26 12:14:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",After foldable from Microsoft i think they will do it 
10660,2020-08-26 12:14:00,+91 97681 67131,I know I read that now issue is they are different companies after all so how things work out is interesting also interesting is to see what amd and intel have in stock... 
10661,2020-08-26 12:15:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","But if Windows and Mac instruction sets diverge, then most software will either stop supporting mac, or will use the automatice translation tools and take a huge performance hit. "
10662,2020-08-26 12:15:00,+91 86559 19035,Amd is beating intel with ryzen for now in most places at lower costs 
10663,2020-08-26 12:15:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Yes because intel n amd will suffer the most 
10664,2020-08-26 12:15:00,+91 97681 67131,True agreed but I know if someone in the industry can make such big changes though foolish and work for them in their favour it’s got to be Apple... 
10665,2020-08-26 12:16:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Not every time. 
10666,2020-08-26 12:16:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",True but will developer take enough efforts? 
10667,2020-08-26 12:16:00,+91 86559 19035,They have given transition period for now and pro stuff stays on intel for now 
10668,2020-08-26 12:16:00,+91 86559 19035,So we have to see what happens 
10669,2020-08-26 12:16:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Adobe does NOT support the latest Mac Pro or the ludicrously expensive ""Pro display"". "
10670,2020-08-26 12:16:00,+91 97681 67131,"Ya that’s the catch Mac app support in App Store isn’t gr8 anyway, with arm chips Apple can bring mobile developers as in iPad OS and iOS developers to develop as well "
10671,2020-08-26 12:17:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Yes, but that will be throwing away like 35+ YEARS of desktop developers. "
10672,2020-08-26 12:17:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Imagine the knowledge and experience. 
10673,2020-08-26 12:18:00,+91 97681 67131,Yes 😂😂 
10674,2020-08-26 12:18:00,+91 86559 19035,Not exactly 
10675,2020-08-26 12:18:00,+91 97681 67131,I agree but I feel they can pull this one off... 
10676,2020-08-26 12:19:00,+91 97681 67131,Plus they aren’t throwing anything to trash Rosetta 2 is helping not arm optimised apps to run at least 
10677,2020-08-26 12:19:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Do u know how irritating it is to develop a UI for different screen size🥺 
10678,2020-08-26 12:20:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Forget UI, do you know how irritating it is to optimize for a different INSTRUCTION SET? "
10679,2020-08-26 12:20:00,+91 97681 67131,Ig they will Microsoft already had office ready on WWDC 2020 announced day to run on Mac so... Also it’s Apple a trillion dollar market cap company they can make it happen... 
10680,2020-08-26 12:20:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Never did that😂😅 
10681,2020-08-26 12:21:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",It will take a loooonng time 
10682,2020-08-26 12:21:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",
10683,2020-08-26 12:21:00,+91 97681 67131,"That’s the catch, since Apple has selected number of products which often use same screen sizes say like se 2020 which is iPhone 6 ka screen only so it’s much easier for them... "

10848,2020-08-27 18:23:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",So if running the same program twice with the same input gives different answers then something has gone horribly wrong. 
10849,2020-08-27 18:28:00,"Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS)",The entire reason chaos theory came into being is that a computer gave out different outputs. Read a little about it. It's a different case but an interesting read

11108,2020-09-03 12:37:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yes exactly I was trying to avoid that 
11109,2020-09-03 12:37:00,+91 97027 35002,To first take string input 
11110,2020-09-03 12:37:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",isliye ek empty nextLine() da;a 
11111,2020-09-03 12:37:00,+91 97027 35002,Then baki sab 
11112,2020-09-03 12:37:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",dala 
11113,2020-09-03 12:38:00,+91 97027 35002,Ya fir avoid nextLine() 
11114,2020-09-03 12:38:00,+91 97027 35002,Aese name middle name surname 3 inputs😂😂 
11115,2020-09-03 12:39:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Change ```String name = s.nextLine(); s.nextLine();``` to ```s.nextLine(); String name = s.nextLine();``` 
11116,2020-09-03 12:39:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Alright thanks 
11117,2020-09-03 12:40:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",And I understood also what wrong I did  Lol 
11118,2020-09-03 12:40:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",so petty mannn 
11119,2020-09-03 12:41:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Good. 
11120,2020-09-03 12:42:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Works like a charm! Thanks 
11121,2020-09-03 12:42:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Because I have repeated this explaintaion 5 times. 
11122,2020-09-03 12:42:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",No problem. 
11123,2020-09-03 12:47:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Ah this 
11124,2020-09-03 12:48:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Dummy string right? 
11125,2020-09-03 12:48:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",No. 
11126,2020-09-03 12:48:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",. 
11127,2020-09-03 12:51:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",It's to clear the channel. The previous input ka enter is still in the channel And if I don't give s.nextLine();  Before the string input  Vo enter gets stored in the string ka variable   So isliye  To avoid that. 
11128,2020-09-03 12:51:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",😤 
11129,2020-09-03 12:52:00,+91 97027 35002,Just remember to this whenever you take a interger etc input before taking string input 
11130,2020-09-03 12:52:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",No. 
11131,2020-09-03 12:52:00,+91 97027 35002,Integer*

11134,2020-09-03 12:52:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",OK listen. 
11135,2020-09-03 12:52:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ok sir. 
11136,2020-09-03 12:52:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Ab khatam😂 
11137,2020-09-03 12:53:00,+91 97027 35002,Idt java me there is something like flushall() 
11138,2020-09-03 12:53:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Scanner operates on a token stream, as opposed to BufferedReader, which operates on lines. "
11139,2020-09-03 12:54:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",
11140,2020-09-03 12:54:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Didn't see the code 
11141,2020-09-03 12:54:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes ik 
11142,2020-09-03 12:54:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Okay 
11143,2020-09-03 12:55:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Now, it is important to understand what the ```nextInt()``` method actually does. "
11144,2020-09-03 12:55:00,+91 97027 35002,Explain sir 
11145,2020-09-03 12:55:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","```nextInt()``` will try to find an *Integer token*, while ignoring any whitespace. "
11146,2020-09-03 12:56:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",An Integer token is defined as ```/(+|-)?\d+/``` 
11147,2020-09-03 12:56:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Meaning + or -, followed by one or more digits. "
11148,2020-09-03 12:57:00,+91 97027 35002,Okay 
11149,2020-09-03 12:57:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","So Scanner reads the token stream, finds 10 and returns it. "
11150,2020-09-03 12:57:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",
11151,2020-09-03 12:58:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Again, we must understand what the ```nextLine()``` method does. "
11152,2020-09-03 12:59:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","```nextLine()``` is actually a special method, that breaks the boundries of a tokenizer. "
11153,2020-09-03 13:00:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","It simply starts reading from the current point, and returns *all characters* till it finds a newline (```\n```). "
11154,2020-09-03 13:00:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",(without the newline) 
11155,2020-09-03 13:01:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","So calling ```nextLine()``` on ```\nHello, World!\n``` will start reading, the stop at the first character because it is a newline. "
11156,2020-09-03 13:01:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",So basically  It returned nothing in my case 
11157,2020-09-03 13:01:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Which means it will return an empty string. 
11158,2020-09-03 13:01:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Yes. 
11159,2020-09-03 13:02:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Alright.  Got it. Thank you. 
11160,2020-09-03 13:02:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",No problem. 
11161,2020-09-03 13:02:00,+91 97027 35002,Ohhhhh 
11162,2020-09-03 13:03:00,+91 97027 35002,Okayyy

11581,2020-09-12 21:14:00,+91 97681 67131,Is it cause by Default java mai variables aren't initialized?? 
11582,2020-09-12 21:14:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",. 
11583,2020-09-12 21:14:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","right,it just checks the syntax "

11588,2020-09-12 21:16:00,+91 97694 89970,If main method ke andar hai na. It's declared inside method so still it is a local variable 
11589,2020-09-12 21:16:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Because of Natkhat Default constructor

11774,2020-09-13 11:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Wait 
11775,2020-09-13 11:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Pehle a = True hua 
11776,2020-09-13 11:17:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",That executes 
11777,2020-09-13 11:18:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Theek hai 
11778,2020-09-13 11:18:00,+91 97739 65140,"no, it doesn't give error. This is valid in java, only if you put it in if then will it give an error "
11779,2020-09-13 11:18:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Then we have or 
11780,2020-09-13 11:18:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Any thing or with true is true 
11781,2020-09-13 11:18:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",So  Baki 2 exp don't get executed 
11782,2020-09-13 11:18:00,+91 91725 67828,Yes 
11783,2020-09-13 11:18:00,+91 97739 65140,"yes, but kya bhai?? Ideally nhi shona chahiye "
11784,2020-09-13 11:19:00,+91 97739 65140,*hona 
11785,2020-09-13 11:19:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Brackets phele hona chaiye right? Saare 
11786,2020-09-13 11:19:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ideally 
11787,2020-09-13 11:19:00,+91 97739 65140,"this is what is happening but think in terms of precedence, this should not happen "
11788,2020-09-13 11:19:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yes got you 
11789,2020-09-13 11:20:00,Tushar Nankani,"boolean a=false,b=false,c=false,x=false;         x = ((a = true) || (b = true) && (c = true));         System.out.print (a + "","" + b + "", "" + c); "
11790,2020-09-13 11:20:00,Tushar Nankani,What about this? 
11791,2020-09-13 11:20:00,+91 97739 65140,"still it should give true, false, false "
11792,2020-09-13 11:21:00,+91 97739 65140,"If you want to understand the logic, think in terms of prefix expression "
11793,2020-09-13 11:21:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",@919773965140  Aisi cheeze bhej te raho 
11794,2020-09-13 11:21:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Massssst hai 
11795,2020-09-13 11:23:00,+91 97739 65140,😂 
11796,2020-09-13 11:24:00,+91 97739 65140,"If anyone of you don't get it, then I will explain "
11797,2020-09-13 11:24:00,+91 97739 65140,what's happening here 
11798,2020-09-13 11:25:00,+91 88284 70904,I understood the false false scenario coz it’s happening due to precedence 
11799,2020-09-13 11:26:00,+91 88284 70904,But the first true ka m not getting 
11800,2020-09-13 11:27:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",-126? 
11801,2020-09-13 11:27:00,+91 97694 89970,Yes correct :) 
11802,2020-09-13 11:28:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Damn how? 
11803,2020-09-13 11:28:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",I mean System.out.println() is an overloaded method 
11804,2020-09-13 11:29:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",It supports all data types if Im not wrong😅 
11805,2020-09-13 11:29:00,+91 97739 65140,x+y is an int 
11806,2020-09-13 11:29:00,+91 97739 65140,Not byte 
11807,2020-09-13 11:29:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Accha waise 
11808,2020-09-13 11:29:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Oh F ha 
11809,2020-09-13 11:29:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Shitt😂 
11810,2020-09-13 11:29:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",I've never used byte till now😂 
11811,2020-09-13 11:30:00,+91 97739 65140,Wait till you see the magic of Strings in Java😂 
11812,2020-09-13 11:30:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","But, I still don't get how? "
11813,2020-09-13 11:30:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",? 
11814,2020-09-13 11:30:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Strings sab language ka ajeeb he lagta hai😅 
11815,2020-09-13 11:30:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Strings in Java are cool 
11816,2020-09-13 11:30:00,+91 97739 65140,😂😂😂 
11817,2020-09-13 11:31:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Nah C/C++ ke sabse ajeb hai 
11818,2020-09-13 11:31:00,+91 97739 65140,smallest storage register size is integer not byte 
11819,2020-09-13 11:31:00,+91 97739 65140,"So, anything smaller than int if you operate them it will always result in int "
11820,2020-09-13 11:32:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Okay   But you declared them as byte ba? 
11821,2020-09-13 11:32:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Na* 
11822,2020-09-13 11:32:00,+91 97739 65140,. 
11823,2020-09-13 11:32:00,+91 97739 65140,This rule holds 
11824,2020-09-13 11:32:00,+91 97694 89970,"If we apply any arithmetic operator between two variables a and b, then the result type is always *max(int , type of a, type of b)* "
11825,2020-09-13 11:32:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Oh okay 
11826,2020-09-13 11:32:00,+91 97739 65140,👍🏻🔥🔥 
11827,2020-09-13 11:33:00,+91 97739 65140,"Bro, in this if you know how expressions are executed You will know we make prefix expression "
11828,2020-09-13 11:33:00,+91 82916 21138,"True,false ,false cause left to right Jayega I guess "
11829,2020-09-13 11:34:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",✅ 
11830,2020-09-13 11:34:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",This ik 
11831,2020-09-13 11:34:00,+91 82916 21138,I had seen this question in my tenth prelims 😂 
11832,2020-09-13 11:36:00,+91 97694 89970,c ka false kaise aaya? I'm getting true false true 🤦🏻‍♂️ 
11833,2020-09-13 11:36:00,+91 97739 65140,
11834,2020-09-13 11:37:00,+91 97739 65140,"Bro, in simple words || is a short circuiting operator "
11835,2020-09-13 11:37:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yess 
11836,2020-09-13 11:38:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",This is short circuit operators ka magic 
11837,2020-09-13 11:38:00,+91 97739 65140,"So, if you have a||b, If a is true, it doesn't operate b "
11838,2020-09-13 11:38:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",🙏🙏 
11839,2020-09-13 11:38:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes

11851,2020-09-13 11:41:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",👍 
11852,2020-09-13 11:41:00,+91 97694 89970,Haa yeh barabar... Uske baad a= true aur b=false rahega. And then c ka? && ke pehle wala expression true hai par abhi aage bhi we have to check na? 
11853,2020-09-13 11:42:00,+91 97739 65140,bro 
11854,2020-09-13 11:43:00,+91 97739 65140,check this 
11855,2020-09-13 11:43:00,+91 97739 65140,"since || is the first operation here , it will short circuit . Had there been any other operation , it would have worked differently "
11856,2020-09-13 11:44:00,+91 97694 89970,Areyyy. Haa got it got it 🙈 
11857,2020-09-13 11:44:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Ye abhi bhi nhi smajha 
11858,2020-09-13 11:44:00,+91 97739 65140,bro this is how computer evaluates your expressions

11871,2020-09-13 11:49:00,+91 97739 65140,"I guess this should work , but only if it is int, float, double. You can't do this for others "
11872,2020-09-13 11:49:00,+91 98206 14506,Woah cool! 
11873,2020-09-13 11:50:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Oh

11875,2020-09-13 11:50:00,+91 82916 21138,Yes 
11876,2020-09-13 11:51:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",<Media omitted>

11880,2020-09-13 11:53:00,+91 82916 21138,Yeah this was in 10th too right tanay ? 
11881,2020-09-13 11:53:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",But the most efficient way is using ex-or 
11882,2020-09-13 11:53:00,+91 97739 65140,kya op hai s=%r;print(s%%s)  ?? 
11883,2020-09-13 11:53:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","Nope lol,not for me "

11885,2020-09-13 11:54:00,+91 82916 21138,One more trick question which java developers gets confused doing c is the increment and decrement 
11886,2020-09-13 11:54:00,+91 82916 21138,Cause in java we go left to right but in c it's anything 😂 
11887,2020-09-13 11:54:00,+91 97739 65140,very true

11892,2020-09-13 11:55:00,+91 82916 21138,I had a fight with my professor last sem on a increment and decrement 😂 while c programming lectures

11894,2020-09-13 11:56:00,+91 82916 21138,Since I was from java background she started telling me you are wrong etc etc and it turned out both were right 😂 
11895,2020-09-13 11:56:00,+91 97739 65140,abbey yaar this is python 2 ka format syntax

11935,2020-09-13 13:57:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I know 1 thing that  All these nums are objects 
11936,2020-09-13 13:57:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",close enough but one concpet threw you off 
11937,2020-09-13 13:57:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",concept*

11947,2020-09-13 14:01:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",yes but.... 
11948,2020-09-13 14:01:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Chal It is related to range onlt na? 
11949,2020-09-13 14:01:00,+91 82916 21138,Haa Nahi bolunga 
11950,2020-09-13 14:02:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",closer 
11951,2020-09-13 14:08:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",range is like byte  -128 to 127 
11952,2020-09-13 14:08:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",yes 
11953,2020-09-13 14:08:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",for some important thing

11957,2020-09-13 14:12:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",but why? 
11958,2020-09-13 14:12:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ill tell you 
11959,2020-09-13 14:12:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",woh bata😂 
11960,2020-09-13 14:12:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Unka loc alag hota hai 
11961,2020-09-13 14:12:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I think so 
11962,2020-09-13 14:13:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",😂😂 
11963,2020-09-13 14:13:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Mein ese he feka tha 
11964,2020-09-13 14:13:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",If you want to compare objects equals() use karna chaiye 
11965,2020-09-13 14:13:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Not == 
11966,2020-09-13 14:13:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Haa a reason 
11967,2020-09-13 14:13:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",
11968,2020-09-13 14:13:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I knew this for String 
11969,2020-09-13 14:14:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",String ke liye always same location hota hai 
11970,2020-09-13 14:14:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",String pool ki vjh se 
11971,2020-09-13 14:14:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",yesssss 
11972,2020-09-13 14:14:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Mereko laga ki jo issue hota hai bade numbers mein hota hai issleye smaller number would be true😂 
11973,2020-09-13 14:14:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",if you want different String then use String Builder/Buffer 
11974,2020-09-13 14:14:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",😂😂 
11975,2020-09-13 14:14:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",😂👍

11977,2020-09-13 14:15:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",This is something new I learnt 
11978,2020-09-13 14:15:00,+91 97694 89970,Yessss right mahn. I was trying to recollect auto boxing and unboxing. 
11979,2020-09-13 14:15:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","yeah,I always used to take it for granted "
11980,2020-09-13 14:15:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Unbox Therapy😂. 
11981,2020-09-13 14:15:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",ki Integer = int 
11982,2020-09-13 14:15:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Ye sem mein sab java pro hai next sem mein sab python pro honge😂 
11983,2020-09-13 14:15:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",😂😂 
11984,2020-09-13 14:15:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",😂

11988,2020-09-13 15:28:00,+91 83292 66084,Yup

11990,2020-09-13 15:29:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Overflow hoke negative side pe gaya 
11991,2020-09-13 15:39:00,+91 97694 89970,"Yes bro. Byte se Int ho jaataa hai woh, phir bcoz of compound assignment operator downcasting or narrowing JVM automatically karta hai jiske karan memory loss hota hai and we get 130 ka in byte as  -126.   But there's a small catch here, agar b = b + 3 likha hota toh humko error milta tha ;) "
11992,2020-09-13 15:40:00,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yes!

11994,2020-09-13 15:47:00,+91 97739 65140,?? 
11995,2020-09-13 15:47:00,+91 97739 65140,Am I correct?

12003,2020-09-13 15:50:00,+91 97739 65140,Because I know Java Strings And I have done a lot of ungli with integers in python 
12004,2020-09-13 15:50:00,+91 97739 65140,Same concept is applied there too 
12005,2020-09-13 15:50:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Oh lol 
12006,2020-09-13 15:50:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",I have not messed much with Python but Java yes

12044,2020-09-13 16:32:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",equals () compares content == compares the reference 
12045,2020-09-13 16:33:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Right? 
12046,2020-09-13 16:33:00,+91 97694 89970,Agar null consider karte toh bhi false false true hi aata

12249,2020-09-14 12:15:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Or should I do it myself? 
12250,2020-09-14 12:16:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Float mai hai 
12251,2020-09-14 12:16:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",#include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; int main() {     static int arr[4][4];     for (size_t i = 0; i < 4; i++)     {         arr[i][i] = 1;     }     return 0; }  C++ 
12252,2020-09-14 12:16:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",is there a way to get the results in int 
12253,2020-09-14 12:17:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You mean like this?  ```int n = 4;  int[][] a = new int[n][n]; for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++)     a[i][i] = 1;``` 
12254,2020-09-14 12:17:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Ha cool 
12255,2020-09-14 12:17:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",yes 
12256,2020-09-14 12:17:00,+91 99693 94098,The dataset is made using 1 and 2 Regarding 3 you can try it out and check for yourself. The model isn't the best out there. It's fast enough for a user to run on colab which provides replicability which is the purpose of the article. 
12257,2020-09-14 12:17:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Print it in this way 
12258,2020-09-14 12:17:00,+91 99693 94098,I have linked the SEGAN paper if you want. I have linked it in the article as well 
12259,2020-09-14 12:17:00,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",@918080142783 definitely knows it 
12260,2020-09-14 12:18:00,+91 99693 94098,GANs will definitely give better results than autoencoders but you can't guarantee replicability with GANs 
12261,2020-09-14 12:19:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",See I am asking if all this is actually worth it? 
12262,2020-09-14 12:20:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Since noise is usually low-amplitude anyways, is there any clear benefit from using an ML model at all. "
12263,2020-09-14 12:21:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","This problem already has an (industy-accepted) solution, so how does your implemetation compare to it? "
12264,2020-09-14 12:22:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","I agree that this is an interesting problem, and any research done here will definately be useful somewhere. "
12265,2020-09-14 12:23:00,+91 99693 94098,"Google is already using it so I guess that speaks for itself Apart from that, noise is low amplitude is not always true. A car horn isn't of a low amplitude. It might also lead to destructive interference or noise distortion. It's not as easy as using a simple filter to filter out every kind of noise "
12266,2020-09-14 12:23:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But what I don't like about ML/AI articles is they make it look like a magic silver bullet that can solve all problems. 
12267,2020-09-14 12:24:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","> Google is already using it so I guess that speaks for itself  Hmmm, in what context? "
12268,2020-09-14 12:24:00,+91 99693 94098,"I'm saying this again, the model in the article is not supposed to be the best. It's supposed to be replicable. The implementation is derived from the SEGAN paper (as mentioned in the article also) "
12269,2020-09-14 12:25:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","> A car horn isn't of a low amplitude.  True, but at that point, you are no longer just removing noise, you are also reconstructing missing audio. "
12270,2020-09-14 12:26:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I asked it to be the best. 
12271,2020-09-14 12:27:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",What does every single article about BubbleSort or InsertionSort or MergeSort end with? 
12272,2020-09-14 12:27:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",The time complexity. 
12273,2020-09-14 12:27:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Why? 
12274,2020-09-14 12:28:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Because it is important to understand the tradeoffs of each implementation. 
12275,2020-09-14 12:28:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",*never. 
12276,2020-09-14 12:30:00,+91 99693 94098,Do you realise that it's not a research paper and ML is purely stochastic? The article is directed towards addressing the two problems mentioned. I realise the tradeoff of each implementation but I don't think it supposed to be in the article. The goal isn't to compare. Its to show how it can be done and how the problems can be addressed 
12277,2020-09-14 12:31:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",> I don't think it supposed to be in the article  I strongly disagree. 
12278,2020-09-14 12:32:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",> Its to show how it can be done and how the problems can be addressed  The article is incomplete if you don't measure the results. 
12279,2020-09-14 12:35:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",@919969394098 so are you doing this? 
12280,2020-09-14 12:39:00,+91 99693 94098,You can try it out and let me know 
12281,2020-09-14 12:43:00,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",OK.

12461,2020-09-20 11:11:00,Tushar Nankani,"I wouldn't mind such initiatives, that would help maintain the gender ratio!  Just that, it's rather sad the score difference is so vast!    Microsoft already has women in tech, Google has women techmaker's scholarship and so many more opportunities by other firms. There should be more gender neutral opportunities, based upon _skills._   I think, even if they have such opportunities, to maintain the ratio, at least score difference shouldn't be so much.   It's a debatable topic, and this is purely my point of view. "
12462,2020-09-20 11:13:00,+91 88284 70904,If they r conducting a coding competition then obviously it should purely be on merit and plus they haven’t specified that it’s for women only or something. So in this case I think it’s completely wrong 
12463,2020-09-20 11:14:00,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",In my opinion if they want to take only a specific gender then only allow them to compete...why to waste others time and make them feel bad of them selfs

12529,2020-09-20 14:22:00,+91 98337 26449,😂😂😂 so all has been undone? Magic? Tada

I don't know how it got all scaled up 😂  Yes, there are a lot of factors overlapping in situations like gender inequality and the caste system.   We all got to know about everyone's perspective to look at it. It's simply not black and white. I got to know a lot from this discussion.   Thank you! "

Google Cloud Crash Course program will provide engineering students an opportunity to kickstart their learning on cloud technology using practice on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.  Each campus can nominate one person to be a facilitator and lead this initiative in their college. Upon nomination and selection, these facilitators will receive some training on how to lead these sessions and motivate more students to participate.  If anyone here has some familiarity with cloud and is interested to become a facilitator, dm me. "

Mostly, they'll solve your problem, else they'll ask you to wait for the mail As for the mail, I've asked the officials about the delay in receiving mails, they said they are sending out mail in batches, so you should receive yours latest by 2nd Oct night "
